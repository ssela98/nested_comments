# Rails 7 (Turbo & Hotwire): Reddit-like Nested Comments

This is the repository linked to the Medium [article](https://medium.com/@tirnavanalessandra/rails-7-turbo-hotwire-reddit-like-nested-comments-92d475e3bbd4) where I give a sneak peak into the possibilities that the newest version of Rails (version 7 at the time of writing) brings.

This application tries to replicate the comments' format of the well-known platform Reddit, all the while making use of `turbo_streams`, `turbo_frames` and the likes as much as possible.

If you notice any errors, or if you have any suggested improvements, then please let me know :)

Other than that, enjoy digging in!

### P.S.A.: No JavaScript was ~harmed~ coded during the development of this!
